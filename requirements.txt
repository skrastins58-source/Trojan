# Trojan Application Dependencies
# ================================
# 
# This application is designed to use only Python standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required for core functionality.
#
# Virtual Environment Setup (Recommended):
# ----------------------------------------
# It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate 
# this application from other Python projects on your system.
#
# To create and activate a virtual environment:
#   python -m venv trojan_env
#   source trojan_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: trojan_env\Scripts\activate
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Python Version Requirements:
# ---------------------------
# Minimum Python version: 3.6
# Recommended Python version: 3.8 or higher
#
# The application will check Python version at startup and provide 
# helpful error messages if requirements are not met.
#
# Optional Development Dependencies:
# ---------------------------------
# If you plan to extend or develop this application, you may want to add:
# - pytest>=6.0.0      # For advanced testing
# - black>=21.0.0       # For code formatting  
# - flake8>=3.8.0       # For code linting
# - mypy>=0.800         # For type checking
#
# Add these dependencies above this comment if needed for development.

# No runtime dependencies required - all functionality uses Python standard library
